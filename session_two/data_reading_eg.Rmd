This example we did at the end of the day shows three different ways to load in a csv file.  You can get this file at http://goo.gl/x87GY6 .

# Traditional

First, let's read the file the traditional way:

```{r}
chs = read.csv("chs2012_codedforR.csv")
```

Summarize it:

```{r}
summary(chs)
```

# data.table

```{r}
library(data.table)
chs2 = fread("chs2012_codedforR.csv", data.table=FALSE)
```

Summarize again:

```{r}
summary(chs2)
class(chs2)
```

# readr

```{r}
library(readr)
chs3 = read_csv("chs2012_codedforR.csv")
```

Summarize:
```{r}
summary(chs3)
class(chs3)
```
